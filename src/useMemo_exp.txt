The useMemo hook is a built-in hook provided by React that allows you to 
memoize the result of a computation and cache it for future use. It 
is used to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computations.

The basic syntax of the useMemo hook is as follows:


const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  // compute and return the value
}, [dependencyList]);

The useMemo hook takes two arguments: a function that 
computes the value and a dependency list.

The first argument is a function that performs the
computation you want to memoize. The value returned
by this function will be stored and cached.

The second argument is an array of dependencies. It specifies
 the values that the memoized value depends on. Whenever any of 
 the values in the dependency list changes, the memoized value 
 will be recomputed. If the dependency list remains unchanged, 
the cached value will be returned without re-computing.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of useMemo:

const MyComponent = ({ list }) => {
  const memoizedResult = useMemo(() => {
    // Expensive computation based on 'list'
    // Return the computed value
  }, [list]);

  // Rest of the component logic using memoizedResult
};

In the example above, the memoizedResult variable will be
updated only when the list dependency changes. If list remains
the same between renders, the cached value will be returned, 
avoiding the expensive computation.

The useMemo hook is particularly useful when you have 
computationally expensive operations, such as complex 
calculations or data transformations, that don't need 
to be re-executed on every render. It allows you to optimize
 the performance of your components by selectively memoizing
 and caching the results of these computations.
