The useSelector hook is a function provided by the React Redux library, 
which is a popular library used for managing state in React
applications using the Redux architecture.


In Redux, the state of an application is stored in a central store,
and components can access and update that state using actions 
and reducers.

//useSelector used to extract data

The useSelector hook allows you to
extract data from the Redux store in a React component.


Here's how you typically use the useSelector hook:
Import the useSelector function from the React Redux library.

import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';
In your functional component, use the useSelector hook to access the data from the Redux store.


const MyComponent = () => {
  const data = useSelector(state => state.myReducer.data); //state.nameofslice.property (property in the initialState)
  
  // ... rest of the component logic
};

//state.nameofslice.property (property in the initialState)


In the example above, state represents the
entire Redux store, and state.myReducer.data
accesses the data property stored in the
myReducer reducer. The useSelector hook 
subscribes to changes in the specified 
data and automatically re-renders the
component when that data changes.


By using the useSelector hook, you can select
and extract only the necessary data from the
Redux store, making your components more focused
and efficient. It also ensures that the 
components only re-render when the 
relevant data changes, optimizing performance.
