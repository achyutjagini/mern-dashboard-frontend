 in JavaScript. Here's an explanation of this specific usage:

The spread syntax ... is typically used to
expand an iterable (like an array or an object) 
into individual elements or properties. It allows
you to use the elements or properties of an 
iterable in places where multiple arguments 
or elements are expected.

In this case, the spread syntax is used in an object literal
 to conditionally include properties based on the
 value of the mode variable. Let's break it down:

mode === "dark" is a comparison expression that checks
 if the mode variable is equal to the string value "dark".
If the comparison mode === "dark" evaluates to true, the object
 properties inside the curly braces {} following the spread 
 syntax will be included in the resulting object.

If the comparison mode === "dark" evaluates to false, 
an empty object {} will be included in the resulting object.
Essentially, this syntax allows for conditional inclusion of 
properties in the object based on the value of mode. If mode
 is "dark", the properties defined inside the curly braces
  will be added; otherwise, an empty object will be added.

Here's an example to illustrate the usage of this syntax:


const mode = "dark";

const obj = {
  prop1: "value1",

  ...(mode === "dark"
    ? {
        prop2: "value2",
      }
    : {}),
  prop3: "value3",
};

console.log(obj);
In this example, if mode is "dark", the 
resulting object will be { prop1: "value1", prop2: "value2", prop3: "value3" }. 
If mode is any other value, the resulting object will be { prop1: "value1", prop3: "value3" }.


       primary: {
            ...tokensDark.primary,
            main: tokensDark.primary[400],
            light: tokensDark.primary[400],

          }, what this means



In the provided code snippet, primary is an object that contains several properties and values. Let's break down what each line means:

...tokensDark.primary: The spread syntax ... is used to spread the properties and values from the tokensDark.primary object. It essentially copies all the properties and values from tokensDark.primary into the primary object being defined.

main: tokensDark.primary[400]: The main property of the primary object is assigned the value at index 400 from the tokensDark.primary object. It's likely that tokensDark.primary is an array or an object that holds a series of color values, and [400] is used to access a specific color value at that index.

light: tokensDark.primary[400]: The light property of the primary object is also assigned the value at index 400 from the tokensDark.primary object. It appears to be the same value as the main property, so it's possible there is a mistake or oversight in this code snippet.

To summarize, the code snippet is creating a primary object with properties and values taken from the tokensDark.primary object. The main and light properties within primary are assigned a specific color value at index 400 from tokensDark.primary.
