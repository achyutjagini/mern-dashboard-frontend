This is a JavaScript code block that exports 
three objects: tokensDark, tokensLight, and themeSettings.

tokensDark is an object that contains color design 
tokens for the dark mode theme. It has three color 
groups: grey, primary, and secondary.

Each color
group contains shades of a specific color in hexadecimal 
format.

The reverseTokens function is also defined, which
is a utility function that returns a new object with each
color group's shades in reverse order. This function is
used to create the tokensLight object, which contains
the color design tokens for the light mode theme.


themeSettings is a function that takes a string parameter
 mode, which specifies the color mode ("light" or "dark") and 
 returns an object with the palette and typography settings for 
 the specified mode. The palette object contains the color design 
tokens for the specified mode, and the typography object contains
the font family and size settings for the specified mode.


The code you provided defines a themeSettings function that generates theme 
settings based on the provided mode (either "dark" or any other value representing the light mode).

Inside the function, an object representing the theme settings is returned. 
It includes a palette property that contains color values based on the specified mode. The color values are obtained from the tokensDark and tokensLight objects.

If the mode parameter is "dark", the palette values for dark mode are assigned. This includes the primary, secondary, neutral, and background colors.

If the mode parameter is not "dark" (indicating light mode), the palette values for light mode are assigned. This also includes the primary, secondary, neutral, and background colors.

The typography property specifies font-related settings such as fontFamily and fontSize for different heading levels (h1, h2, h3, etc.).

Overall, this code defines a function that generates theme settings based on the provided mode, with color palettes and typography configurations.
